Hello there!
Here for the whiff of the day as well?

...

Oh, not a fellow appreciator of the odeur, I see.

Please! Good sir!
Let me take you on a journey, and unveil to you:
the magical world of aroma.

FIRST! Please close your eyes.

SECOND! Take a DEEP breath through your nose.

Make sure you can feel ALL of your nose hair tingling.

THEN! Hold your breath for as long as you can.

If you REALLY focus; you can make out the individual smells
that make up today's bouquet.

Sense the music of ___?
Sense the dance of sweaty train seats
and ___,
with long-forgotten burger wrapping quietly clapping along?

Now THAT is the magic of the (synonym for smell).

I hope to have enlightened you, sir.

I will now bid you adieu!

(Do you want to frogify or go the next individual?)
