Hello there!
Here for the whiff of the day as well?

...

Oh, not a fellow appreciator of the odeur, I see.
Please! Good sir!
Let me take you on a journey, and unveil to you:
the magical world of aroma.

FIRST! Please close your eyes.

SECOND! Take a DEEP breath through your nose.
Make sure you can feel ALL of your nose hair tingling.

THEN! Hold your breath for as long as you can.
If you REALLY focus; you can make out the individual smells
that make up today's bouquet.

Do you sense the music of sour tennis socks in the air?
The dance of sweaty train seats and morning breath,
with long-forgotten burger wrapping quietly clapping along?

Now THAT is the magic of the nasal symphony!

I hope to have enlightened you, sir.
I will now bid you adieu!

(Do you want to frogify or go the next individual?)
