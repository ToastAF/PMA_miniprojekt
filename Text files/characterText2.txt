Oh noes! My nose knows
not what its not
supposed to do... :(

'Ello there! Here for the
whiff of the day as well?

...

Oh, not a fellow appreciator
of the odeur, I see.

Please! Good sir!
Let me take you on a journey,
and unveil to you:
the magical world of aroma.

First! Please close your eyes.

Second! Take a DEEP breath
through your nose.

Make sure you can feel ALL of your
nose hair tingling.

Then! Hold your breath
for as long as you can.

If you REALLY focus;
you can make out the individual smells
that make up today's bouquet.

Sense the music of ___?
Sense the dance of sweaty train seats
and ___,
with long-forgotten burger wrapping
quietly clapping along?

Now THAT is the magic of the
(synonym for smell).

I hope to have enlightened you, sir.

I will now bid you adieu!
