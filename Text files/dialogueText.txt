Hey man, isn't it quite warm to wear such
a large robe? Especially at this time of
the year.

Not that I can talk with all this gear, but
I'm going on an adventure, so don't knock me.

Have you seen that guy with the long nose?
He seems kinda off, don't ya think...?

Anyway, what do you want?

(Do you want to frogify or go to the next individual?)
