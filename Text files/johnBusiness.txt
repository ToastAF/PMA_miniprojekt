Hello there my friend!
Are you perhaps also on you way to the
businees conference in business city?

No? Well that just means more business
for me, HA!

You see, I may look like a tiny man,
but I do have quite the knack for
doing business, I tell you!

I once sold a broken swarglekoof to
an unsuspecting old woman on the
streetcorner for five schmeelings.
Those normally only go for two of
those, haHA!

(Do you want to frogify or go the next individual?)
