HEY!

What's your deal!?

Think I don't know what you're doing, do ya!?

I sussed you out as soon as you stepped foot on this train.

You want to hear about the cute cat I saw on my way to the station!
You want to hear about it SO BAD!

Well, good thing I also want to talk about it then!

His collar said Ruffles, but I named him Shookie, and he DID NOT complain!

He has brown and grey fur and likes to be pet!

His meow sounds really funny! He sounds like he's imitating a crow!

Too bad he was already wearing a collar.
If he wasn't I would have taken him in and given him as many pats he'd want!

But I'll just hope to meet him in the streets another time!

Well! That's all! I told you all about Shookie!

Now SCRAM!

(Do you want to frogify or go to the next individual?)
