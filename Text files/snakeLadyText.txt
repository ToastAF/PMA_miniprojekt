Oh, I'm sssorry. Is the energy from my crystal collection obstructing your magic?

Don't worry. I'm getting off on the next ssstop.

...

I collected all of these myself youknow?

I used to travel a lot when I was younger, but nowadays I just throw the rocks at birds.

The ssserpentine crystal has the best aim, but it's fun to experiment with the others as well.
