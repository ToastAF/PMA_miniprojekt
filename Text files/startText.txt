Hello and welcome to game

As a wizard, it is your duty to keep the inhabitants of the city on their best behavior.

See someone acting unruly? Turn them into a frog for a few hours! That'll teach 'em!

The train line has noticed an increase in rudeness as of late,
and have hired you to show the passengers what's what.

Talk to the passengers on this train and figure out who could use a good lesson in manners.
But be careful: not everyone has bad intentions.
